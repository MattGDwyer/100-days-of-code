### Day 1: April 5th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I got to day 46 last attempt at this. I am giving it another go. Today I finished the first project algorithm for the Freecodecamp Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures certificate. I also planned out how I'm going to accomplish the Roman Numeral Converter Algorithm

**Thoughts** I'm excited to be back on this with my accountability partner @rico042002. I've made a lot of progress since my last attempt, and am excited to show it! I will be working on some real world stuff after I am done with this certificate.
