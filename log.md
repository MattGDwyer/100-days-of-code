# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 15, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I'm planning out an app to work on with a software engineer. Choosing technologies to learn. Also starting freecodecamp's Responsive Web Design Certificate. As well, intend to do at least one toy problem a day to work on my problem solving process.

**Thoughts** I already have a good understanding of JS/HTML/CSS. Have some exposure to node and React. I want to solidify my core concepts while working on real world problems. Here goes!

### Day 2: November 16, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Worked a lot on getting ready to do things. Didn't work on enough actual code! Deciding what technologies to learn while building an app that interacts with google maps api. Gonna be so cool! Did a toy problem that took me far longer than it should have. Also disappointed in my implementation. That's why I want to do them every day.

**Thoughts** I want to get these toy problems down to where I can do them relatively quickly. I have difficulties interpretting the language in them, and I often pattern match without knowing exactly what is going on.

### Day 3: November 17, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Relatively productive day. Got through a lot of solidifying my html/css knowledge. Didn't finish my toy problem today. Will finish in the morning.

**Thoughts** HTML/CSS: picking up things I didn't know. I realize much of HTML tags aren't used, but good to get to know them. CSS is full of tricks and secrets. I am really pondering how to quickly comprehend a toy problem prompt. Today's was Symmetric Differences. I had no idea what they were, but when I created a real-world version of the processes being carried out in imy head, I understood within a minute. Good to know. I still have issues with logic errors. Currently, my solution compares only 1 of the 2 arrays. Also intend to start using helper functions ALL THE TIME. Not there yet though.

### Day 4: November 18, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Decent day. Not great, but decent. Getting into CSS animations. Very cool. Same toy problem from yesterday still not solved. Know what I need to do to finish it. It should be relatively easy.

**Thoughts** I ran into problems dealing with the arguments object. I thought I knew what I needed to know about how the arguments object works. It appears you cannot directly return an argument by accessing it using bracket notation. ie: return arguments[0]. It is difficult to know when to dig into a topic. So instead of reading in depth about it, I blindly tried things based on my understanding of how it works. I've heard countless times that you need to understand your code before using it, and not just try things to see if they work. However, I wasted a ton of time doing that on this problem. Knowing it and doing it are two very different things. I will be very happy to solve it, and rewrite the code that has now deteriorated into its most rudimentary form.

### Day 5: November 19, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: More CSS complete. Looking forward to the projects. Should be on them by Saturday

**Thoughts** Still haven't solved the Toy Problem I am working on. I took most of 2 weeks off from coding prior to this. It really shows. Can't wait to work on my JS fundamentals. Maybe tomorrow? Fighting through it.

### Day 6: November 20, Friday

**Today's Progress**: CSS tutorial complete! Tomorrow I get to start working on some pure html/css webpages. Haven't done that before. Looking forward to it. Toy problem still giving me trouble. Didn't spend much time on it, probably because I am frustrated.

**Thoughts** Looking forward to playing around with CSS all by itself. No jQuery, no React, nothing. Haven't done that before. Javascript is where I have spent the majority of my time. Having this simple comparison problem cause me so many problems is really frustrating. It is surprising how much my comprehension regressed in such a short period. Lesson learned. As well, my issues largely stem from a lack of recent practice with recursion. I have a few recursion problems to practice. Moving forward, those will be what I'm working on!

### Day 7: November 21, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started the first Responsive Web Design project on freecodecamp. Planning to be done with mvp of all projects by the end of Monday. Finally finished findSymmetricalDifference.

**Thoughts** I am constantly looking at my problem solving process. Today I did a couple of things that I want to take a moment to point out:

      1: I had a notebook and a pencil. On the left side of the page I wrote my pseudocode. On the right side I wrote my visualization. My visualizations still need work, but this made it plain to see whether my logic was working, and if I missed a step/misused something. Moving forward I will be more detailed with my visualization, so I don't miss anything.

      2: Instead of immediately setting a breakpoint, and stepping through my code, I wrote my stream of thought out. I wrote what was happening, what I wanted to happen, and what potential solutions were. After that I stood up, took a 5 minute break, and came back to it. 2 minutes later I had it solved.

### Day 8: November 22, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Working on FCC projects. Almost done with first certificate.

**Thoughts** My habit of pattern matching, and guessing what will be the answer continues to be a problem. I am aware of it. However, awareness and action are two different things. I hereby commit to not writing a single line of code (CSS or otherwise) that I do not understand!

### Day 9: November 23, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Still working on FCC projects. Learned Corvid today. Its basically jQuery.

**Thoughts** Had no idea what Corvid was when I woke up today. Now I'm building a portfolio page for a friend using it! Interesting that it is nearly identical to jQuery so far. Can't say I love working with the Wix GUI. Onward and upward! Never give up! Never Surrender!

### Day 10: November 24, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Working on a portfolio page for a friend. Learning how to manipulate wix page without using GUI. Corvid docs are decent...

**Thoughts** Now that I am familiar with corvid, I will be writing code with it, as opposed to using the "easy" way out (using all of the confusingly organized menus in the gui). It works just like jQuery.

### Day 11: November 25, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I did a sort algorithm as a toy-problem. Merge Sort.

**Thoughts** Good to be working on an algorithm again today, and these sorts are a great resource!

### Day 12: November 27, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Working on FCC project.

**Thoughts** Building good habits moving forward with html and css. Got over my frustration with css by finding some good resources for knowing what properties work well with each other.

### Day 13: November 28, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished current FCC project.

**Thoughts** Got to the point where I was adjusting things over and over. Down the rabbit hole I went. Seems to be a constant danger for me, and in CSS. I feel a lot more confident with the way things interact in CSS. While the project I built is not perfect, it does represent a lot of work. I think its time to move on to the next project. I'm embarrassed to share it in its current state, but here it is:

### Day 14: November 30, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Layed out the html framework for an FCC project

**Thoughts** Continued using the same project building process. Sketching a wireframe, writing out the html, and then the CSS to give it form. Seems to be working well for me.

### Day 15: December 1, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished FCC project. Think it looks good, actually.

**Thoughts** I unexpectedly had a lot of fun making this page as close to picture perfect as I could. CSS no longer feels daunting. I've figured out the problem solving process. To me, it requires a foundation of knowledge of interactions between certain properties. ie: certain things are reserved for grid, flexbox, and certain cascade principles will totally destroy your project if you don't know how they work.
