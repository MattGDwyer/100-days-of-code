# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 15, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I'm planning out an app to work on with a software engineer. Choosing technologies to learn. Also starting freecodecamp's Responsive Web Design Certificate. As well, intend to do at least one toy problem a day to work on my problem solving process.

**Thoughts** I already have a good understanding of JS/HTML/CSS. Have some exposure to node and React. I want to solidify my core concepts while working on real world problems. Here goes!

### Day 2: November 16, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Worked a lot on getting ready to do things. Didn't work on enough actual code! Deciding what technologies to learn while building an app that interacts with google maps api. Gonna be so cool! Did a toy problem that took me far longer than it should have. Also disappointed in my implementation. That's why I want to do them every day.

**Thoughts** I want to get these toy problems down to where I can do them relatively quickly. I have difficulties interpretting the language in them, and I often pattern match without knowing exactly what is going on.

### Day 3: November 17, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Relatively productive day. Got through a lot of solidifying my html/css knowledge. Didn't finish my toy problem today. Will finish in the morning.

**Thoughts** HTML/CSS: picking up things I didn't know. I realize much of HTML tags aren't used, but good to get to know them. CSS is full of tricks and secrets. I am really pondering how to quickly comprehend a toy problem prompt. Today's was Symmetric Differences. I had no idea what they were, but when I created a real-world version of the processes being carried out in imy head, I understood within a minute. Good to know. I still have issues with logic errors. Currently, my solution compares only 1 of the 2 arrays. Also intend to start using helper functions ALL THE TIME. Not there yet though.

### Day 4: November 18, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Decent day. Not great, but decent. Getting into CSS animations. Very cool. Same toy problem from yesterday still not solved. Know what I need to do to finish it. It should be relatively easy.

**Thoughts** I ran into problems dealing with the arguments object. I thought I knew what I needed to know about how the arguments object works. It appears you cannot directly return an argument by accessing it using bracket notation. ie: return arguments[0]. It is difficult to know when to dig into a topic. So instead of reading in depth about it, I blindly tried things based on my understanding of how it works. I've heard countless times that you need to understand your code before using it, and not just try things to see if they work. However, I wasted a ton of time doing that on this problem. Knowing it and doing it are two very different things. I will be very happy to solve it, and rewrite the code that has now deteriorated into its most rudimentary form.

### Day 5: November 19, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: More CSS complete. Looking forward to the projects. Should be on them by Saturday

**Thoughts** Still haven't solved the Toy Problem I am working on. I took most of 2 weeks off from coding prior to this. It really shows. Can't wait to work on my JS fundamentals. Maybe tomorrow? Fighting through it.

### Day 6: November 20, Friday

**Today's Progress**: CSS tutorial complete! Tomorrow I get to start working on some pure html/css webpages. Haven't done that before. Looking forward to it. Toy problem still giving me trouble. Didn't spend much time on it, probably because I am frustrated.

**Thoughts** Looking forward to playing around with CSS all by itself. No jQuery, no React, nothing. Haven't done that before. Javascript is where I have spent the majority of my time. Having this simple comparison problem cause me so many problems is really frustrating. It is surprising how much my comprehension regressed in such a short period. Lesson learned. As well, my issues largely stem from a lack of recent practice with recursion. I have a few recursion problems to practice. Moving forward, those will be what I'm working on!

### Day 7: November 21, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started the first Responsive Web Design project on freecodecamp. Planning to be done with mvp of all projects by the end of Monday. Finally finished findSymmetricalDifference.

**Thoughts** I am constantly looking at my problem solving process. Today I did a couple of things that I want to take a moment to point out:

      1: I had a notebook and a pencil. On the left side of the page I wrote my pseudocode. On the right side I wrote my visualization. My visualizations still need work, but this made it plain to see whether my logic was working, and if I missed a step/misused something. Moving forward I will be more detailed with my visualization, so I don't miss anything.

      2: Instead of immediately setting a breakpoint, and stepping through my code, I wrote my stream of thought out. I wrote what was happening, what I wanted to happen, and what potential solutions were. After that I stood up, took a 5 minute break, and came back to it. 2 minutes later I had it solved.

### Day 8: November 22, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Working on FCC projects. Almost done with first certificate.

**Thoughts** My habit of pattern matching, and guessing what will be the answer continues to be a problem. I am aware of it. However, awareness and action are two different things. I hereby commit to not writing a single line of code (CSS or otherwise) that I do not understand!

### Day 9: November 23, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Still working on FCC projects. Learned Corvid today. Its basically jQuery.

**Thoughts** Had no idea what Corvid was when I woke up today. Now I'm building a portfolio page for a friend using it! Interesting that it is nearly identical to jQuery so far. Can't say I love working with the Wix GUI. Onward and upward! Never give up! Never Surrender!

### Day 10: November 24, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Working on a portfolio page for a friend. Learning how to manipulate wix page without using GUI. Corvid docs are decent...

**Thoughts** Now that I am familiar with corvid, I will be writing code with it, as opposed to using the "easy" way out (using all of the confusingly organized menus in the gui). It works just like jQuery.

### Day 11: November 25, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I did a sort algorithm as a toy-problem. Merge Sort.

**Thoughts** Good to be working on an algorithm again today, and these sorts are a great resource!

### Day 12: November 27, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Working on FCC project.

**Thoughts** Building good habits moving forward with html and css. Got over my frustration with css by finding some good resources for knowing what properties work well with each other.

### Day 13: November 28, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished current FCC project.

**Thoughts** Got to the point where I was adjusting things over and over. Down the rabbit hole I went. Seems to be a constant danger for me, and in CSS. I feel a lot more confident with the way things interact in CSS. While the project I built is not perfect, it does represent a lot of work. I think its time to move on to the next project. I'm embarrassed to share it in its current state, but here it is:

### Day 14: November 30, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Layed out the html framework for an FCC project

**Thoughts** Continued using the same project building process. Sketching a wireframe, writing out the html, and then the CSS to give it form. Seems to be working well for me.

### Day 15: December 1, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished FCC project. Think it looks good, actually.

**Thoughts** I unexpectedly had a lot of fun making this page as close to picture perfect as I could. CSS no longer feels daunting. I've figured out the problem solving process. To me, it requires a foundation of knowledge of interactions between certain properties. ie: certain things are reserved for grid, flexbox, and certain cascade principles will totally destroy your project if you don't know how they work.

### Day 16: December 2, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Not much to show. Deciding what projects to include in my portfolio page project to finish out the HTML/CSS certificate on FCC.

**Thoughts** I would like to take a moment to talk about rabbit holes. This project has a lot of them, as do all coding projects. But this one has me thinking about it. My plan is to quickly skim through my work to find the things that I won't have to do any work to, and still be ok with other people seeing them. That's my goal at least... The more work I do on my own, the more I find that having a plan that improves from learning, and some rules to follow, are what keep me from wasting my time in various ways.

### Day 17: December 3, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Picked out the projects I want to show for my portfolio.

**Thoughts**  Having a rough go of it in the rest of my life. I'm gonna stay focused on this and health. They are the most important things in my life, and will keep making me feel good. Covid sucks.

### Day 18: December 4, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Wireframe complete for portfolio. Chose some animations and figured out how they work.

**Thoughts**  Need some motivation. So much going on outside of this. I'd be missing days if I didn't have
@rico042002 holding me up. Thank you Rico. In other news, most of my github repos are either empty, or private. I need to push my work up to the empty ones, and some of the private ones can be made public. Not my focus, but I need to make it reflect my body of work so far.

### Day 19: December 5, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed more of the portfolio page project.

**Thoughts**  Getting excited about this one. The creativity aspect of front end work is really a place where I can get inspiration. Once I find something that gets me going, I am like a pitbull.

### Day 20: December 6, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Portfolio coming together. It pleases me.

**Thoughts**  I've found a way to both satisfy the FCC test cases and make it a project that I can continue to use to show my progress learning. Hyperfocus has its benefits.

### Day 22: December 8, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Portfolio MVP complete. Will start animating, and deploy tomorrow

**Thoughts**  I'm ok with it. Once I am able to animate it, I will like it a lot more. It needs some work, but it looks good. codepen is frustrating.

### Day 23: December 9, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Playing around with various creative touches.

**Thoughts**  I absolutely love making cool looking pages. If I could get paid to do this, that would be a dream come true.

### Day 24: December 10, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Played around too much. Now the page alignment isn't what I want...

**Thoughts** Another situation where I needed to step away and rethink what I'm doing. I went way down ta rabbit hole, but at least I saw it and I pulled myself out.

### Day 25: December 11, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Done w/responsive web design certificate.

**Thoughts** Its not everything I want it to be, but it represents me building something from scratch to a specific aesthetic. There is creative thought here. There is a lot that could be done to improve this, but that isn't the point. The point is, I moved the dial forward today, and finished a certificate.

### Day 26: December 12, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Time spent figuring out HTML5 Boilerplate

**Thoughts** Not the day I anticipated. Spent reading docs on vscode, updating vscode, making sure vscode is operating in the right directory, reading and rereading the docs etc. Its late. I'm sure I'll be good in the morning.

### Day 27: December 13, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Learning how to deploy using node, express and heroku

**Thoughts** Good time learning some node and how to use heroku. Tomorrow will learn express.

### Day 26: December 14, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Working through express tutorial.

**Thoughts** I have to say, I adore backend work. Maybe its the kid in me that learned how to build/modify things from DOS. Point is, gimme a green/gray font over a black background and I'm happy plugging away at learning how to build a server.

### Day 27: December 15, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Building a js pomodoro timer

**Thoughts** I bullet journal using onenote. yesterday I realized Onenote has native embedding of repl.it. That's a big deal to me! So today I decided to start work on a pomodoro timer using straight js. Sadly, I need a library to play the audio I'd like, but that should be no big deal. I found one. Tomorrow I should be able to finish it no problem! Fun!

### Day 28: December 17, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Building a js pomodoro timer

**Thoughts** After dealing with 6 hours of trying to fix my macbook overheating... Decided to make the pomodoro a simple web app that focuses on the challenges of having ADHD. This is potentially a path I wan to move in with my career. I've found several tutorials to use. I'm gonna make a deadline for myself: Dec 19th: done and polished. Moving on.

### Day 29: December 19, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finish MVP for pomodoro timer

**Thoughts** Got a neat little pomodoro timer with no styling, but a progress bar. Needs styling and alerts/sounds. But good start.

### Day 30: December 21, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through some of JS Algorithms and Data Structures for the certificate.

**Thoughts** I've been lost. Lost in a sea of suggestions and opinions on what it takes to become a full stack software engineer. It has made me lose sight of my goal. I see that. Now I am building my unique point A to point B. This is will be what I believe to be the path for me to get there. In that, I realize I need the structure of a program like freecodecamp. I also will be determining deadlines for personal "real world" projects. That includes my portfolio. Godspeed Matt Dwyer. You got this. Thank you @rico042002 for undying support.

### Day 32: December 23, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working through JS certificate on freecodecamp.

**Thoughts** I took some time and wrote out what I view as my roadmap to my ideal software engineering job. I will be revisiting my portfolio, expanding on it, doing more toy problems, and not feeling guilty for being sidetracked. I also worked through freecodecamp js problems.

### Day 34: December 26, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working through JS certificate on freecodecamp.

**Thoughts** More work on js certificate. Picking up a few things I missed, like a strong definition of type coercion.
