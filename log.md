# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 15, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I'm planning out an app to work on with a software engineer. Choosing technologies to learn. Also starting freecodecamp's Responsive Web Design Certificate. As well, intend to do at least one toy problem a day to work on my problem solving process.

**Thoughts** I already have a good understanding of JS/HTML/CSS. Have some exposure to node and React. I want to solidify my core concepts while working on real world problems. Here goes!
