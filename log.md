# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 15, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I'm planning out an app to work on with a software engineer. Choosing technologies to learn. Also starting freecodecamp's Responsive Web Design Certificate. As well, intend to do at least one toy problem a day to work on my problem solving process.

**Thoughts** I already have a good understanding of JS/HTML/CSS. Have some exposure to node and React. I want to solidify my core concepts while working on real world problems. Here goes!

### Day 2: November 16, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Worked a lot on getting ready to do things. Didn't work on enough actual code! Deciding what technologies to learn while building an app that interacts with google maps api. Gonna be so cool! Did a toy problem that took me far longer than it should have. Also disappointed in my implementation. That's why I want to do them every day.

**Thoughts** I want to get these toy problems down to where I can do them relatively quickly. I have difficulties interpretting the language in them, and I often pattern match without knowing exactly what is going on.

### Day 3: November 17, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Relatively productive day. Got through a lot of solidifying my html/css knowledge. Didn't finish my toy problem today. Will finish in the morning.

**Thoughts** HTML/CSS: picking up things I didn't know. I realize much of HTML tags aren't used, but good to get to know them. CSS is full of tricks and secrets. I am really pondering how to quickly comprehend a toy problem prompt. Today's was Symmetric Differences. I had no idea what they were, but when I created a real-world version of the processes being carried out in imy head, I understood within a minute. Good to know. I still have issues with logic errors. Currently, my solution compares only 1 of the 2 arrays. Also intend to start using helper functions ALL THE TIME. Not there yet though.
